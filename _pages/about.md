I am a phd student at [PUC](mat.uc.cl) under the advise of [Crist√≥bal Rojas](https://www.mat.uc.cl/personas/perfil/cristobal.rojas) and [Sebasti√°n Barbieri](http://www.sbarbieri.usach.cl/).

In this moment I am writing a thesis, and also looking for future postdoc positions. A research statement can be found [here](Research_statement.pdf). Please let me now if you have some relevant information!
