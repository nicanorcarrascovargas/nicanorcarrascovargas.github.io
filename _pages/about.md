I am a postdoctoral researcher at Jagiellonian University, under the supervision of Adam Kanigowski.

Previously, I was a phd student at [Pontifical Catholic University of Chile](https://www.mat.uc.cl/) under the advise of [Cristóbal Rojas](https://www.mat.uc.cl/personas/perfil/cristobal.rojas) and [Sebastián Barbieri](http://www.sbarbieri.usach.cl/).

My research has focused on subshifts on finietly generated groups, with an emphasis on their recursive properties. This has taken me to some objects on infinite graphs, such as translation-like actions by $\mathbb{Z}$ and infinite Eulerian paths.
