My name is Nicanor Carrasco-Vargas. I am a postdoctoral researcher at Jagiellonian University with Adam Kanigowski.

Previously, I was a PhD student at [Pontifical Catholic University of Chile](https://www.mat.uc.cl/) with [Crist√≥bal Rojas](https://www.mat.uc.cl/personas/perfil/cristobal.rojas) and [Sebasti√°n Barbieri](http://www.sbarbieri.usach.cl/).

I like dynamics and computability.
