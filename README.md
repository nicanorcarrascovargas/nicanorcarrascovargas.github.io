## Al-folio modified
This is a personal webpage created using the theme "al-folio", and the credit is to the respective authors. You can fork this version freely. I have made some slight modifications  towards the typical format used by mathematicians (Home, Research, Talks, and CV). In particular, it has a separate bibliography for Talks, and these bibliographies are written on the CV page using a diferent layout.

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license).
Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
