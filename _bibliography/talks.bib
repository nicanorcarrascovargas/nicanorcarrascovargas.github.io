      year={2025},
      abstract={
An automorphism of a topological dynamical system is a homeomorphism of the space that commutes with the dynamics. The automorphism group of a system is the set of its automorphisms with the group operation of composition, and it is a topological conjugacy invariant.

In a seminal paper from 1969 Hedlund began the study of automorphism groups of fullshifts. He proved that this group is countable and contains many groups. Since then, automorphism groups of subshifts have often been studied through their subgroups. Mixing properties of a subshift have been related with more subgroups in the automorphism group, while low complexity of the subshift has been related to a smaller class of subgroups.

A prominent open question is whether the 2-shift and 3-shift have the same automorphism groups. It is known that they can not be distinguished by their subgroups, and that the 2-shift and 4-shift have different automorphism groups. In the talk I will talk about these things and a recent work with S.Barbieri and P.Rivera-Burgos.},

      title={Medvedev degrees of subshifts}, 
      year={2024},
      abstract={The Medvedev degree of a subshift is an invariant of topological conjugacy that measures how hard is to find configurations in the subshift from the viewpoint of recursion theory. These degrees share some properties with topological entropy for amenable groups, such as being non-increasing by factor maps, and having a simple behavior for direct products and disjoint  unions.

                  In this talk I will present the basic theory of Medvedev degrees of subshifts, and some results about the classification problem of these degrees for subshifts of finite type on different finitely generated groups.

                  As a motivation I will present some applications of the existence of SFTs with nontrivial Medvedev degree. For instance, this is a key ingredient in Hochman's proof that in the space of $\mathbb{Z}^2$-actions on the Cantor space, there is no action with residual topological conjugacy class (i.e. that the theorem of Kechris and Rosendal for $\mathbb{Z}$-actions is not true for $\mathbb{Z}^2$-actions).

En esta charla discutiremos cómo este fenómeno se captura con un invariante dinámico para                   subshifts, el invariante m. Este invariante comparte algunas propiedades con la entropía topológica como no aumentar por factores.                También se relaciona con otras propiedades de origen dinámico y topológico tales como la aperiodicidad o la existencia puntos                     aislados en el espacio de todos los subshifts.},
