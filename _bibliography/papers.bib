      abstract={We show that every infinite graph which is locally finite and connected admits a translation-like action by $\mathbb{Z}$ such that the distance between a vertex $v$ and $v∗1$ is uniformly bounded by 3. This action can be taken to be transitive if and only if the graph has one or two ends. This strengthens a theorem by Brandon Seward. 
Our proof is constructive, and thus it can be made computable. More precisely, we show that a finitely generated group with decidable word problem admits a translation-like action by $\mathbb{Z}$ which is computable, and satisfies an extra condition which we call decidable orbit membership problem.
As an application we show that on any finitely generated infinite group with decidable word problem, effective subshifts attain all effectively closed  Medvedev degrees. This extends a classification proved by Joseph Miller for $\mathbb{Z}^{d}, d≥1$.

      abstract={The Erdős, Grünwald and Weiszfeld theorem provides a characterization of infinite graphs which are Eulerian. That is, infinite graphs which admit infinite Eulerian trails. In this article we complement this theorem with a characterization of those finite trails that can be extended to infinite Eulerian trails. This allows us to prove an effective version of the Erdős, Grünwald and Weiszfeld theorem for a class of graphs that includes non locally finite ones, generalizing a theorem of D.Bean.},

      abstract={Using tools from computable analysis we develop a notion of effectiveness for general dynamical systems as those group actions on arbitrary spaces that contain a computable representative in their topological conjugacy class. Most natural systems one can think of are effective in this sense, including some group rotations, affine actions on the torus and finitely presented algebraic actions. We show that for finitely generated and recursively presented groups, every effective dynamical system is the topological factor of a computable action on an effectively closed subset of the Cantor space. We then apply this result to extend the simulation results available in the literature beyond zero-dimensional spaces. In particular, we show that for a large class of groups, many of these natural actions are topological factors of subshifts of finite type.},
