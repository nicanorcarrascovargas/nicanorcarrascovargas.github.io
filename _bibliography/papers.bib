      abstract={We show that every infinite, locally finite, and connected graph admits a translation-like action by $\mathbb{Z}$, and that this action can be taken to be transitive exactly when the graph has either one or two ends. The actions constructed satisfy $d(v,v\ast 1)\leq 3$ for every vertex $v$. This strengthens a theorem by Brandon Seward. We also study the effective computability of translation-like actions on groups and graphs. We prove that every finitely generated infinite group with decidable word problem admits a translation-like action by $\mathbb{Z}$ which is computable and satisfies an extra condition which we call decidable orbit membership problem. As a nontrivial application of our results, we prove that for every finitely generated infinite group with decidable word problem, effective subshifts attain all $\Pi_1^0$​ Medvedev degrees. This extends a classification proved by Joseph Miller for $\mathbb{Z}^d,d\geq 1$.},

      abstract={The Erdős, Grünwald and Weiszfeld theorem provides a characterization of infinite graphs which are Eulerian. That is, infinite graphs which admit infinite Eulerian trails. In this article we complement this theorem with a characterization of those finite trails that can be extended to infinite Eulerian trails. This allows us to prove an effective version of the Erdős, Grünwald and Weiszfeld theorem for a class of graphs that includes non locally finite ones, generalizing a theorem of D.Bean.},

      abstract={Using tools from computable analysis we develop a notion of effectiveness for general dynamical systems as those group actions on arbitrary spaces that contain a computable representative in their topological conjugacy class. Most natural systems one can think of are effective in this sense, including some group rotations, affine actions on the torus and finitely presented algebraic actions. We show that for finitely generated and recursively presented groups, every effective dynamical system is the topological factor of a computable action on an effectively closed subset of the Cantor space. We then apply this result to extend the simulation results available in the literature beyond zero-dimensional spaces. In particular, we show that for a large class of groups, many of these natural actions are topological factors of subshifts of finite type.},

      abstract={Let G be a group with undecidable domino problem (such as $\mathbb{Z}^2$). We prove the undecidability of all nontrivial dynamical properties for sofic G-subshifts, that such a result fails for SFTs, and an undecidability result for dynamical properties of G-SFTs similar to the Adian-Rabin theorem. For G amenable we prove that topological entropy is not computable from presentations of SFTs, and a more general result for dynamical invariants taking values in partially ordered sets.},

      author={Sebastián Barbieri and Nicanor Carrasco-Vargas},
      year={2024}, abstract={The Medvedev degree of a subshift is a dynamical invariant of computable origin that can be used to compare the complexity of subshifts that contain only uncomputable configurations. We develop theory to describe how these degrees can be transferred from one group to another through algebraic and geometric relations, such as quotients, subgroups, translation-like actions and quasi-isometries.
We use the aforementioned tools to study the possible values taken by this invariant on subshifts of finite type on some finitely generated groups. We obtain a full classification for some classes, such as virtually polycyclic groups and branch groups with decidable word problem. We also show that all groups which are quasi-isometric to the hyperbolic plane admit SFTs with nonzero Medvedev degree. Furthermore, we provide a classification of the degrees of sofic subshifts for several classes of groups.},
