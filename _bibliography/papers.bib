      abstract={We show that every infinite graph which is locally finite and connected admits a translation-like action by $\mathbb{Z}$ such that the distance between a vertex $v$ and $v∗1$ is uniformly bounded by 3. This action can be taken to be transitive if and only if the graph has one or two ends. This strengthens a theorem by Brandon Seward. 
Our proof is constructive, and thus it can be made computable. More precisely, we show that a finitely generated group with decidable word problem admits a translation-like action by $\mathbb{Z}$ which is computable, and satisfies an extra condition which we call decidable orbit membership problem.
As an application we show that on any finitely generated infinite group with decidable word problem, effective subshifts attain all effectively closed  Medvedev degrees. This extends a classification proved by Joseph Miller for $\mathbb{Z}^{d}, d≥1$.

      abstract={The Erdős, Grünwald and Weiszfeld theorem provides a characterization of infinite graphs which are Eulerian. That is, infinite graphs which admit infinite Eulerian trails. In this article we complement this theorem with a characterization of those finite trails that can be extended to infinite Eulerian trails. This allows us to prove an effective version of the Erdős, Grünwald and Weiszfeld theorem for a class of graphs that includes non locally finite ones, generalizing a theorem of D.Bean.},
